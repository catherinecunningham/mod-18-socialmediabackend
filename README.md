# Module 18 Challenge - Social Media Backend

This application shows the backend functionality of a social media website.  It includes API routes to get all users, get a single user by ID, post a new user, update a user by their ID, and delete a user.

It also includes the ability to post to a user's friend list and remove friends from their friend list.

When users post thoughts to their social media page, you can get all of their thoughts, get a single thought by ID, post a new thought, update a thought, and delete a thought.

Users are able to react to what other users post as thoughts, and reactions can be deleted.

This application was created with help from TAs and tutors in the course.

A screenshot of the code and routes in Insomnia is shown below.
